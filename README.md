# **RuneChange**

Small app that pulls and sets runes based on champ

![demo image](https://github.com/eugenethreat/RuneChange/blob/main/resources/runechanger_gui1.png)

## **TODO**: 
Spin up Discord API - check if Discord has r/w/x permissions to set runes 

Clean up datadragon pattern matching

update datadragon to latest version 

Add routine to not crash on connection while client is spinning up 

Add panels for individual runes  

create launcher / native runtime 

## **Problems**:
LCU wrapper only runs locally - can't be entirely server side 
-create lightweight client that takes care of setting runes 
-might need to write own api that interacts w client, ie:
